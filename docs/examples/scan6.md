Abstract - This paper discusses the source rock quality of the lacustrine shales within Groups K, L and M in the
southern flank of the Malay Basin. This study is made possible through the use of state-of-the-art technique of gas
chromatography / mass spectrometry / mass spectrometry or GCMSMS to provide highly selective measurements of
biomarkers which are typically in low concentrations in source rock extracts, oils, and especially in condensates. Since
only one well dataset is available, only the vertical variation in the source rock quality of the lacustrine shales is discussed.
Stratigraphically, there is a noticeable change in the source rock quality within the three groups. In general, the TOC
content of the lacustrine shale sequences in Groups K, L and M range from 0.35 to 2.00 wt%. Kerogen composition of
these shales varies, showing mixtures of Type I to Type III indicating variable contributions from algal, bacterial and
higher plant organic matter deposited in highly to less oxidising environments. This is indicated by hydrogen index (HI)
values ranging from 137 to 403. Group L lacustrine shales provide the best oil-prone source rock with TOC values of
0.45 to 1.95 wt% and HI values in the range of 300 to 400 indicating predominantly Type II kerogens. The variation in
the source rock quality within the Groups K, L and M may be due to a combination of organic source input and factors
controlling the preservation of organic matter within the environments of deposition. This observation is supported by
data from screening and microscopic analyses of whole rocks and alkane and biomarker analyses of source rock extracts.
It appears that Groups L and M shales, deposited in a lacustrine environment, received more algal input compared to
terrigenous organic matter in a less oxic condition resulting in relatively better organic matter preservation. This is shown
by the lower Pr/Ph ratio in the range of 3.1 to 4.0, lower Im/Ts ratio, moderate to high abundance of C30-diahopame and
low abundance of tricyclics and gammacerane. On the other hand, the younger Group K had more fluvial influence and
consequently received relatively more terrigenous organic matter input being deposited in a more oxidising environment.
This is indicated by the higher Pr/Ph ratio (5.1 to 6.2), higher abundance of oleanane, predominance of C:29-sterames
compared to C27- and C28-steranes, and trace amounts of tricyclics and gammacerame. It is also observed microscopically
that Group K has higher abundance of terrigenous-derived vitrinite particles available for measurements as opposed to

INTRODUCTION
It has been well documented that the oils and condensates of the Malay Basin are being generated by two main source rocks - lacustrine and fluviodeltaic, with varying degrees of mixing between them (EPIC, 1994; Mccaffrey et al., 1998). However, a recent study on the petroleum systems of the northern part of the Malay Basin has also shown that fluvial marine source rocks could also generate these oils (Madon et al., 2006). The gradual change from lacustrine, through parallic and fluviodeltaic, to open marine in the source rock successions reflects the sedimentary evolution of the basin. The lacustrine source rocks, consisting of shales, occur in the Oligocene/Early Miocene K, L, and M groups. Fluviodeltaic source rocks, on the other hand, found mainly in the Lower-Middle Miocene I and E groups are mainly made up of coastal plain shales and coal carbonaceous shales. This paper is partly the result of a study carried out by PETRONAS to determine the source facies of the recently
discovered oils in the basement rocks within the Anding Utara area. The aim of this paper is to discuss the vertical variation in source rock quality of the lacustrine shales in Groups K, L and M. For this purpose, Anding Barat Laut-1 (ABL-1) was selected as it is stratigraphically the deepest well within the study area (Figure 1). Lacustrine shales have been recognised as perhaps the single most oil-prone facies, especially in the Southeast Asian Tertiary basins (Cole & Crittenden, 1997). In the Malay Basin, it has been widely accepted that lacustrine shales are closely associated with the sediments of Groups K, L and M (Figure 2). The oldest lacustrine source rocks (Group M) were deposited in isolated half-grabens during the synrift phase where sedimentation took place during the extentional phase of basin development, occuring as half-graben fills. The transition between the synrift and post-rift occurred during the L and early part of K times. Although the lakes were perhaps small initially, they may have evolved into larger lakes as the basin subsided rapidly.
